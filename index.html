                <p>A fricative is a consonant produced by forcing air through a narrow channel made by placing two articulators close together.[1] These may be the lower lip against the upper teeth, in the case of [f]; the back of the tongue against the soft palate in the case of German [x] (the final consonant of Bach); or the side of the tongue against the molars, in the case of Welsh [ɬ] (appearing twice in the name Llanelli). This turbulent airflow is called frication.

                <p>Uvulars are consonants articulated with the back of the tongue against or near the uvula, that is, further back in the mouth than velar consonants. Uvulars may be stops, fricatives, nasals, trills, or approximants, though the IPA does not provide a separate symbol for the approximant, and the symbol for the voiced fricative is used instead. Uvular affricates can certainly be made but are rare: they occur in some southern High-German dialects, as well as in a few African and Native American languages. (Ejective uvular affricates occur as realizations of uvular stops in Lillooet, Kazakh, or as allophonic realizations of the ejective uvular fricative in Georgian.) Uvular consonants are typically incompatible with advanced tongue root, and they often cause retraction of neighboring vowels.</p>

                <p>A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). Syllables are often considered the phonological "building blocks" of words. They can influence the rhythm of a language, its prosody, its poetic metre and its stress patterns. Speech can usually be divided up into a whole number of syllables: for example, the word ignite is made of two syllables: ig and nite.</p>

                <p>A series of iconic tone letters based on a musical staff was devised by Yuen Ren Chao in the 1920s by adding a reference stave to the existing convention of the International Phonetic Alphabet. The stave was adopted by the IPA as an option in 1989 and is now nearly universal. When the contours had been drawn without a staff, it was difficult to discern subtle distinction in pitch. Only nine or so of the possible tones were commonly distinguished: high, medium and low level, [ˉa ˗a ˍa] (or as dots rather than macrons for 'unaccented' tones); high rising and falling, [ˊa ˋa]; low rising and falling, [ˏa ˎa]; and peaking and dipping, [ˆa ˇa], though more precise notation was found and the IPA specifically provided for mid rising and falling tones if needed. The Chao tone letters were originally x-height, but are now taller to make distinctions in pitch more visible.</p>

			   <p class="text"> The woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an extinct species 
				of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene until its extinction in the 
				Holocene epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. 
        The woolly mammoth began to diverge from the steppe mammoth about 800,000 
			years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant.
			 DNA studies show that the Columbian mammoth was a hybrid between woolly 
			 mammoths and another lineage descended from steppe mammoths. The appearance 
			 and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric 
			 animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and North 
			 America, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction 
			 from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known 
			 in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin 
			 of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being 
			 remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct 
			 species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.</p>
